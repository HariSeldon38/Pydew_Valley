Notes :

maybegood to check the video about delta time
about dt : we need to store position into pos and not inside the rect. 
		because a rect store the pos as an integer and we use dt to 
		move everything in framerate indep way we will have often float so --> error
		so we move the pos vector and then we update the rect based on that

I want the whole game to be in french

spy on Math to see exactly what input she is used to

I did duplicate some frame in idle animation in order to have a slower animation for idling
NO a good thing to do I know, need to change that from the code if I find the time

os.walk(path) returns ('path', [subfolders], [file_names])
